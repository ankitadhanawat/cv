## Internships and Research Experience
- **MS Thesis :** A modelling study using WRF-Chem over north India with improved transport and waste burning emissions  
      Mentored by - Prof. Vinayak Sinha, IISER Mohali  
      
      Anthropogenic emissions can affect the local, regional, and global air quality and climate considerably. The road transport and waste burning sectors are the major contributors to anthropogenic emissions of India. In this work, we study road transport and open waste burning emissions using the WRF-Chem regional transport model. We incorporate new road transport and waste burning emission inventories over India in the WRF-Chem setup.
 
 
- **Summer 2020 :** Study of the biogenic emissions using upadated tree cover in the MEGAN model  
      Mentored by - Prof. Vinayak Sinha, IISER Mohali  
      
      There are a lot of discrepancies in actual tree cover over India and the one MEGAN module uses to give the predictions. Trees significantly impact land-atmosphere feedbacks through evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and isoprene emissions. We replaced the existing tree cover by the improved one and studied the differences in isoprene emission, planetary boundary layer height, and temperature with the ground measurements and satellite data
