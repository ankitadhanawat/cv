## Experience in Atmospheric modelling
- **PhD Project:** Emission estimates of radiatively active species at the regional scale using inverse modelling techniques.\
   Mentored by - Prof. Michela Maione, University of Urbino, Italy\
  I use the analytical Bayesian inversion system to evaluate optimised fluxes of synthetic GHGs at the European country scale, using continuous, high-quality observations from the European observatories combined with footprints obtained using the atmospheric transport model(FLEXPART)

 - **PARIS Horizon Europe:**  Estimation of European Black Carbon fluxes using inverse modelling. [link](https://horizoneurope-paris.eu/source-attribution-for-european-aerosols/)\
  Mentored by - Prof. Michela Maione, University of Urbino, Italy\
  I am involved in WP7, source attribution of European aerosols, of the PARIS Horizon Europe research project. I am leading the deliverable which aims to estimate European black carbon
    emission fluxes using top-down methods. I am also developing an optimization algorithm for wet-scavenging coefficients in the wet deposition parametrization scheme in the FLEXPART model.
   
- **MS Thesis:** A modelling study using WRF-Chem over north India with improved transport and waste-burning emissions  
      Mentored by - Prof. Vinayak Sinha, IISER Mohali  
      
   Anthropogenic emissions can affect the local, regional, and global air quality and climate considerably. The road transport and waste-burning sectors are the major contributors to the anthropogenic emissions in India. In this work, we study road transport and open waste burning emissions using the WRF-Chem regional transport model. We incorporate new road transport and waste-burning emission inventories over India in the WRF-Chem setup.
 
 
- **Summer 2020:** Study of the biogenic emissions using updated tree cover in the MEGAN model  
      Mentored by - Prof. Vinayak Sinha, IISER Mohali  
      There are a lot of discrepancies in actual tree cover over India and the one MEGAN(Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) uses in the WRF-Chem setup. Trees significantly impact land-atmosphere feedback through evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and isoprene emissions. We replaced the existing tree cover with the newly created tree cover dataset improving isoprene emissions, planetary boundary layer height, and temperature with the ground measurements and satellite data.
