## Internships and Research Experience
- **MS Thesis :** A modelling study using WRF-Chem over north India with improved transport and waste burning emissions  
      Mentored by - Prof. Vinayak Sinha, IISER Mohali  
      
   Anthropogenic emissions can affect the local, regional, and global air quality and climate considerably. The road transport and waste-burning sectors are the major contributors to the anthropogenic emissions in India. In this work, we study road transport and open waste burning emissions using the WRF-Chem regional transport model. We incorporate new road transport and waste-burning emission inventories over India in the WRF-Chem setup.
 
 
- **Summer 2020 :** Study of the biogenic emissions using upadated tree cover in the MEGAN model  
      Mentored by - Prof. Vinayak Sinha, IISER Mohali  
      There are a lot of discrepancies in actual tree cover over India and the one MEGAN(Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) uses in the WRF-Chem setup. Trees significantly impact land-atmosphere feedback through evapotranspiration, photosynthesis, and isoprene emissions. We replaced the existing tree cover with the newly created tree cover dataset improving isoprene emissions, planetary boundary layer height, and temperature with the ground measurements and satellite data.
 
 - **Summer 2019 :** Setting-up optical tweezers and make a photo-acoustic sensor using Febri-Perot cavity  
 Mentored by - Dr Sameer Biswas, IISER Mohali  
 My project was to develop a Fabri-Perot cavity-based sensor which can detect small photo-acoustic vibrations. This can be used to monitor living cells.
 
 - **Summer 2018 :** Optimization of RF waves using genetic algorithm  
  Mentored by - Dr Kavita Dorai, IISER Mohali  
  I learned about quantum unitaries and quantum gates in this project. I also learned about genetic algorithms and their wide applications.

## Course-work projects
 
- Statistical physics: Implementation of Metropolis and Wolff algorithm on Ising model in python  
  This project explores the Metropolis algorithm and its implementation on 2D Ising model in great detail. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to calculate various critical parameters involved. [code](https://github.com/saurabh-annadate/Implementation-of-Metropolis-and-Wolff-algorithm-on-Ising-model-in-python) 
 
- Field-work: Study of anthropogenic emissions and mitigation effects of Happy seeder in rural India  
 In this project I surveyed farmers to know the paddy residue burning practices in detail. I also gathered the information of usage of happy seeder and studied it's mitigating effects on climate change.
